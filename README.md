# Text Classifier Project

A machine learning based text classification pipeline designed to demonstrate end-to-end NLP workflow including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

This project was built as part of my portfolio to showcase practical experience in building applied ML systems and working with textual data.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically classify text samples into predefined categories using classical machine learning techniques.

The project covers the full ML lifecycle:

- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction
- Model training
- Evaluation and comparison
- Prediction pipeline
